## How to Use

1. Download a supported executor listed in the  [Discord server](https://discord/dEKX9XnZwS).

2. Execute the provided loadstring below.
```luau
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtTheZenith/LunarVape/main/Loader.lua", true))()
```

3. Wait until a notification appears indicating Lunar Vape has loaded.
(The game may freeze due to a bad executor, wait 1-2 minutes as the script downloads all of the data and icons.)

## Possible Issues
Half of the time its usually the scripting utility at fault, please make sure the utility meets certain quality standards such as.
1. Supporting file functions & the debug library.
2. Not implementing lua generated / half baked versions of such functions resulting in unintended behavior.
3. Maintaing the same behavior across all usages of said functions.

### User Issues
If its not the supposed utility at fault, please try some troubleshooting steps.
1. Deleting the Lunar Vape folder in your executor's workspace (WITH THE GAME CLOSED).
2. Making sure you have connection to [the main loadstring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtTheZenith/LunarVape/main/Loader.lua).
3. Ensuring no external script is conflicting with vape.
